# ExerciseMinder: Customer Acquisition & Retention Simulation

📊 **Overview**  
This project explores a 5-year marketing strategy simulation for a fictional fitness tracker brand, *ExerciseMinder*, using real-world frameworks like **RACE** and **See–Think–Do–Care**. The goal: optimize **customer acquisition**, **retention**, and **ROMI** across digital channels using A/B testing, regression analysis, and campaign iteration.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- A/B testing revealed **value-driven messaging** outperforms short-term discounting for retention.
- **Email and branded search** consistently delivered the highest ROI.
- Regression analysis uncovered underperforming channels (e.g., TV) and improved spend allocation.
- Lifetime value (CLV) doubled over time by shifting from high-churn acquisition to loyalty campaigns.
